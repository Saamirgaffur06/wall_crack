Steps to get the Project:


Step 1:-



      Go to the One Drive Link



Step 2:-



      You will find the training and the validation folder which cantains the Image Dataset.



      You will find the trained model file which have accuracy of 98%



Step 3:-


      You can predict the real time wall images using the trained model in the predict.py file


                                                OR




      You can train the model in the train.py file using the datset and can obtain higher accuracy and then predict with the real time images
